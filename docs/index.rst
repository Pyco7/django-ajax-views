Welcome to django-ajax-views's documentation!
=============================================

This library is built upon Django's class based views and works in conjunction with JS library require-ajax-views.

The idea is to map the logic of django views with javascript views.
Since javascript doesn't define classes and inheritance, I've used coffeescript client side.
This way you can define classes and simply use inheritance to extend functionality.

This library is still in beta.
